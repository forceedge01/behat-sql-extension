# genesis-behat-sql-extension
Provides easy data manipulation with any PDO enabled database for Behat.

Installation
------------
require with composer
```bash
require "genesis/behat-sql-extension"
```

=======
Instantiation

-------------

Instantiating the sql extension in your FeatureContext class.

```php
use Genesis\SQLExtension\Context;

$databaseParams = [...];
$this->sqlContext = new Context\SQLContext(
    new Context\DBManager($databaseParams),
    new Context\SQLBuilder(),
    new Context\LocalKeyStore(),
    new Context\SQLHistory()
);
```

Setup
-----
After composer has installed the extension you would need to setup the connection details. This can be done in 2 ways:

###1. Behat.yml

In addition to the usual mink-extension parameters, you can pass in a `connection_details` parameter as follows:
```yaml
default:
    extensions:
        Genesis\SQLExtension\Extension:
          goutte: ~
          ...
          # Database connection details
          connection_details:
            engine: pgsql
            host: 127.0.0.1
            port: 3306
            schema: ...
            dbname: ...
            username: ...
            password: ...
            dbprefix: ...
          # Keywords to be used with the sql extension steps
          keywords:
            ...
          notQuotableKeywords:
            ...
```

In the above example, the `keywords` section provides injection of keywords. For example you can have:
```yaml
default:
    extensions:
        ...:
          ...
          keywords:
            qwerty: thisisthehashofthepassword
```

This will make the `qwerty` keyword usable as follows:

```gherkin
Given I have a "user" where "email:its.inevitable@hotmail.com,password_hash:{qwerty}"
```
Note the use of `{qwerty}` keyword. `{qwerty}` will be replaced with `thisisthehashofthepassword`.

The 'notQuotableKeywords' provide a way to specify mysql functions you do not wish to put in quotes when the SQLContext generates
the SQL query. These are expected to be regular expressions but without the delimiters. The defaults that are already set are:

```php
$keywords = [
  'true',
  'false',
  'null',
  'NOW\(\)',
  'COUNT\(.*\)',
  'MAX\(.*\)',
  'DATE\(.*\)',
  '\d+'
];
```

Note: The `schema` is a very important parameter for the SQLContext, if you are working with multiple databases don't set a fixed schema. To reference a table from another database simply prefix that databases' name as per the sql convention and it will be used as your schema on the fly for that table. If you are just using one database in your application set the schema the same as the database.

###2. Environment variable

An environment variable can be set for the database connection details in the following way:

```bash
$ export BEHAT_ENV_PARAMS="DBENGINE:mysql;DBHOST:127.0.0.1;DBSCH..."
```

Fields required are
```
DBENGINE
DBHOST
DBSCHEMA
DBNAME
DBUSER
DBPASSWORD
```

The fields needs to be preset but may be left empty.

DB Support

Contributing to this extension
==============================

Calls provided by this extension
--------------------------------

### Inserting data in a table

This will run an insert query using the @where/@with data provided
```gherkin
# file: insert.feature

# replace @table with your table name, include schema if table is stored in a schema
# @with/@where are used synonymously in this call
Given I have a "@table" where "@where"
```

To insert more rows at once the above statement can be re-written as follows:

```gherkin
# file: insert.feature

Given I have "@table" where:
  | column1            | column2            |
  | row1-column1-value | row1-column2-value |
  | row2-column1-value | row2-column2-value |
```

The above will insert two rows.

### Deleting data in a table

This will run a delete query against the database using the @where/@with criteria given
```gherkin
# file: delete.feature

# @with/@where are used synonymously in this call
Given I do not have a "@table" where "@where"
```

### Updating data in a table

This call will run an update query on the database records matching the @where clause
```gherkin
# file: update.feature

# @table for this to make sense your table should represent an entity
# @update the field you would like to update e.g email:someone@somewhere.com
# @where this functions exactly the same as the sql where clause
# Format for @update and @where is "email:its.inevitable.com,id:1,isActive:true"
Given I have an existing "@table" with "@update" where "@where"
```
### Using the not operator.

You can use the not operator to say a column should not be equal to value as follows:
```
Then I should have a "user" with "email:its.inevitable@hotmail.com, active: !null" in the database
```

This will generate `active is not null`. For a value other than null it would generate`column != value`.

The same can be written as:
```
Then I should have a "user" with:
    | column | value                      |
    | email  | its.inevitable@hotmail.com |
    | active | !null                      |
```
Note the top row is just explanatory, it will not be used as part of the query.

### Performing a LIKE search.

You can perform a LIKE clause with the following format:

```
Then I should have a "user" with "user_agent:%Firefox%" in the database
```

### Re-using values from another record

After creating or updating data you can assign the record's values to a keyword with the following clause
```gherkin
# file: reuse.feature

# Create a new user.
Given I have a "user" where "email:its.inevitable@hotmail.com"
# The table needs to have the column 'id' for this to work
And I save the id as "user_id"

# With the above command you can use "some_id" as follows
# Note the use of "some_id" keyword in the following statement
Given I have an "account" where "title:my account, user_id:{user_id}"
```

The `Given I have ...` command will do two things for you:
  - Attempt to create a new record if it doesn't exist.
  - Save all columns of that new record for re-usability in its keywords store. These are accessible like so: {table.column}
  Example:
    - Consider a table user with the following columns:
      - id
      - name
      - email
      - role_id
    - This `Given I have a "user" where "email: its.inevitable@hotmail.com"` will give you the following keywords:
      - {user.id}
      - {user.name}
      - {user.email}
      - {user.role_id}

### Referencing foreign table values

To substitute a value from another table use the following syntax:

```gherkin
Then I should have a "table" where "column1:value1, column2:[table1.columnToUse|whereColumn:Value]"
```

Putting the above into context.
```
column1: value1 # Usual sql syntax.
column2: [table1.columnToUse|whereColumn:Value] # External reference to the table `table1`
```

The above syntax i.e `[...]` will be resolved as follows:
```sql
SELECT `table1.columnToUse` FROM `table1` WHERE `whereColumn` = 'Value';
```

### Verifying data in the database

Verify the database records as follows:
```gherkin
Then I should have a "user" with "email:its.inevitable@hotmail.com,status:1" in the database
```

Note: the 'in the database' part of the step definition is optional and is only for clarity of the step definition.

### Debug mode

Debug mode can be used to print sql queries and results to the screen for quick debugging.
```gherkin
# file: debug.feature

# Enable debug mode to check for errors
Given I am in debug mode
And I have a "user" where "email:its.inevitable@hotmail.com"
```

The above "I have" command will output something like this to the screen:
```bash
Executing SQL: INSERT INTO user (email) VALUES ('its.inevitable@hotmail.com')

Last ID fetched: 57
```

### Extended use in feature context file.

The extension provides wrapper methods for the same functionality as the dsl language. To give the code more context use the following:

```php
  $this
    ->select($table, $where) # select a record, essentially perform a iHaveAnExistingWhere.
    ->insert($table, $where) # Insert a new record if it does not exist, same as iHaveAWith
    ->update($table, $update, $where) # Update an existing record, same as iHaveAnExistingWithWhere
    ->delete($table, $where) # Delete a record, same as iDontHaveAWhere
    ;
```

Anything the DSL does will be done using the above methods (i.e setting keywords, outputting to debug log etc...)

### Upgrading from version 2.x to 3.0:

The only major change in version 3.0 is the introduction of the SQLHistory object. Just set the constructor object and that should be it.
